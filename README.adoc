toc::[]

== Installation
. If you haven't already, install link:https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js].
. {repo}/releases[Download the latest release of RPC.]
. Run `npm i` from its directory from your console.

== Usage
See the link:./saves/example.js[example] to learn how to configure a save file, which is what stores the configuration for a rich presence. +
You can then use `node rpc.js --use savename` to use the save, or `npm run start` for your default.

[TIP]
====
You can create custom scripts in link:./package.json[package.json] for shortcuts to your favorite saves.
[source,javascript]
"scripts": {
  "start": "node rpc.js",
  "birb": "node rpc.js --use birbsarelife"
};
// 'npm run birb' starts the 'birbsarelife' save
====

=== Adding images
. Go to the link:https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me[developers page] and create an application.
. Scroll down to where it says "Rich Presence" and enable it.
. Upload your images according to their size. Their names will be what to specify in the save as `largeImageName` and `smallImageName`.
+
IMPORTANT: Remember to hit the save button!
. Scroll back up to the top and copy your application's client ID. This will be the first option in your save file.

=== Extra configuration
link:./config.json[Config.json] is already included, so modifying it is completely optional. However, you can still change it if you like.

`default`:: Name of default save to run if `--use` is not specified.
`saveFolder`:: The path to your save folder, if you'd like to store them somewhere else.
