# RPC
Uses [discord-rich-presence](https://github.com/devsnek/discord-rich-presence) to give you a simple way to save different presence configurations and use them later.

### Install
1. Clone or download this repo.
1. Run `npm i` in its directory.
- Chrome may flag the repo as having a virus, this may just be warning you that there's a [.bat](./startRPC.bat) file included. It's a small, clickable shortcut to start the program.
  - If you still feel cautious, the entire source of the program is here, it isn't very big. Feel free to look around. üëç

#### Setting up custom images

  1. Go to the [developers page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and create an application.
  1. Scroll down to where it says in big bold letters "Rich Presence", and enable it.
  1. Upload your images. Their names will be what to specify in the config as "largeImageName" and "smallImageName". Remember to save it!
  1. Scroll up and grab its client ID. This is what you put as the first option in your saves.

## Usage Instructions

- See [the example](./saves/example.js) to learn how to configure a presence.
- To run a presence, use `node rpc.js --use savename` inside the directory.
  - If you want, you can specify your own scripts in `package.json` for shortcuts to your favorites.
- Extra options can be found in [config.json](./config.json)!
  - `default` - Default save to use when `--use` is not specified
  - `saveFolder` - Path to save folder
  
  ### Future plans
  - [x] Clickable file to start program
  - [ ] Perhaps a cool-looking menu?
  - [ ] Editing saves restarts them live
  - [ ] Rotating RPC (adjustable time change)
